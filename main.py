# The Dealer's Play When the dealer has served every player, the dealers face-down card is turned up. If the total is
# 17 or more, it must stand. If the total is 16 or under, they must take a card. The dealer must continue to take
# cards until the total is 17 or more, at which point the dealer must stand. If the dealer has an ace, and counting
# it as 11 would bring the total to 17 or more (but not over 21), the dealer must count the ace as 11 and stand. The
# dealer's decisions, then, are automatic on all plays, whereas the player always has the option of taking one or
# more cards.

# That was acutally crazy hard to find took me like 20 mins of googling to find the dealers rules????
